**Name: Craft (INT)**  
You are trained in a craft, trade, or art such as electronics, sculpture, mechanics, weaponmaking, starship construction, carpentry, computer technology, droid construction, or some other endeavor that actually creates a finished product. A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something; if a skill is not of this sort, it is a Profession skill.  
Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You can have several Craft skills. For instance, you could have the skill Craft (electronic devices). Your ranks in that skill don't affect any checks you happen to make for different Craft skills, such as Craft (blaster pistols and rifles) or Craft (droids), for example.  
Examples of Craft skills include tha following. Your GM may allow other Craft skills, depending on the campaign.  
Before you can use a Craft skill, you must purchase a set of basic tools. The cost of these tools varies according to the complexity of the item you want to build (see the accompanying table). The tools to make an item of a certain complexity can also be used to make any item of lower complexity. To upgrade your basic tools and thus be able to make items of higher complexity, you only need to spend the difference in cost between the tools you have and the tools you are acquiring. For example, if you spend 150 credits on basic tools to make items of high complexity, you can also make items of medium and low complexity using the same tools. If you later decide you want to make items of extreme complexity, you must spend another 850 credits (1,000 minus 150) to acquire the necessary tools.  
Having the ideal tools for the job creates a condition of favorable circumstances, giving you a +2 circumstance bonus on all you Craft checks. The cost to acquire ideal tools for items of a certain complexity is 10 times the cost of basic tools. For example, the cost of ideal tools to make items of high complexity is 1,500 credits.  
**Check:** The basic function of the Craft skill is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The price of the item and your check results determine how long it takes to make the item. The items' price also determines the cost of raw materials (the parts and components necessary to build the item).  
To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item:  

1. Find the item's price in the Equipment List, or have the GM set the price for an item not listed.  
2. Pay one-third the item's price in raw materials.  
3. Make a skill check that represents one day's work.  

Multiply the check result by your skill modifier (your skill ranks + your Intelligence modifier + miscellaneous modifier). If that number equals or exceeds the item's price, then you have completed the item.  
If your check result multiplied by your skill modifier is less than the item's price, then that number represents progress you've made this day toward completing the item. Subtract the amount of progress from the item's price and record the new reduced value. At the end of the next day of work, make another check. Each day, you make more progress until the day when your check result multiplied by your skill modifier equals or exceeds the item's remaining value. At that point, you have completed the item.  
You can hand an unfinished item over to someone else to complete, or, if the item is sufficiently large, multiple craftsman can work on the item simultaneously. In either case, use the total results of all the Craft checks applied to the item to determine when the item is finished. Upon the items completion, make another Craft check to determine whether the item functions as intended. If you fail the check
