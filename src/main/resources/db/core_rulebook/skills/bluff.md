**Name: Bluff (CHA)**      
You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible. The skill encompasses conning, fast-talking, misdirection, prevarication, and misleading through body language. Use a bluff to sow temporary confusion, get someone to turn his head in the direction you point, or simply to look innocuous.   
**Check:** A Bluff check is opposed by the targets Sense Motive check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances can weigh against youL The Bluff is hard to believe or the action that the bluff requires the target to take does against the target's self-interest, nature, personality, or orders.  
If it's important, the GM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target get a +10 bonus because the bluff demands something risky of the target, and the target's Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much as see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the target's Sense Motive check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen through the bluff (and would have done so even if it had bot placed any demand on him).  
A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less), or the target believes something that you want them to believe. For example, you could use a bluff to put someone off guard by telling them someone was behind them. At best, such a bluff would make the target glance over their shoulder. It would not cause the target to ignore you and completely turn around.  
A bluff requires interaction between the character and the target
