**Name: Bluff (CHA)**      
You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible. The skill encompasses conning, fast-talking, misdirection, prevarication, and misleading through body language. Use a bluff to sow temporary confusion, get someone to turn his head in the direction you point, or simply to look innocuous.   
**Check:** A Bluff check is opposed by the targets Sense Motive check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances can weigh against youL The Bluff is hard to believe or the action that the bluff requires the target to take does against the target's self-interest, nature, personality, or orders.  
If it's important, the GM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe.
