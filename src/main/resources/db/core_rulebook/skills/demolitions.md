Use this skill to create and set explosive devices for maximum impact.  
**Check:** Setting a simple explosive to blow up a certain spot doesn't require a check, but any attempt to build an explosive device or set an explosive to cause a specific damage effect does.  
_Set Explosive:_ Placing an explosive in the optimum location for maximum blast efficiency takes skill and patience. The GM makes the check (so you don't know exactly how well you've done), compares it to the list of DCs on the table below, and applies the result for the highest DC that's equal to or less than the check result. For example, a result of 19 produces a blast that does double damage and provides a -2 penalty to the Reflex save of anyone caught in the blast area. A failed check (a result of 9 or lower) reduces the explosive power by half,
