**Name: Balance (DEX)**  
<!-- _Force Skill; Requires Feats; Armor Check Penalty_ -->  
You can keep your balance while walking on a tightrope, a narrow beam, a ledge, or a uneven floor.  
**Check:** You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface. A failure means that you can't move for that round. A failure by 5 or more means that you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface.
