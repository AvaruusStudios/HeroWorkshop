These shoprt, fur-covered humaniods have had hyperspace travel for thousands of years and were among the first civilizations to join the galactic society. Bothans deal in information. They use information as a measure of wealth and power, even wielding it as a weapon when necessary. The Bothan Spynet serves as one of the largest intelligence agencies throughout most eras, and it plays and important and poignant role in the Rebellion era. Culturally, Bothans don't believe in direct conflict. They prefer to manipulate situations from behind the scenes, to watch and wait for information and opportunity, and to use these tools to gain status and influence.",
    "personality": "Bothans are manipulative, crafty, suspicious and curious by anture, and a little paranoid. They can be irritating, but they are also loyal and brave.",

    "language": "Bothans speak and read Bothese and Basic.",
    "adventurers": "Bothan adventurers, such as operatives in the Spynet, engage in daring deeds - even when such deeds put them at great personal risk. In addition to the intelligence operatives, Bothan heroes serve as soldiers and pilots, diplomats and ambassadors. Their curiosity leads some to be explorer and scouts. Even when a Bothan makes it hard not to look for the profit and prestige in the situation.",

The species includes more females than males, and Cerean society is matriarchal. Their high-domed heads hold binary brians, and two hearts beat in a Cerean's chest. With a non-aggressive heritage, it is only rarely that a Cerean develops the desire to adventure, and even more rare that one takes up the robes of a Jedi Knight.",

Even so, when a cause or situation turns a Cerean to this path, he or she tries to approach life with as many of the Cerena beliefs as possible. Aggression should be the last resort after all peaceful solutions are attempted, for example. The binary brain allows a Cerean to constantly weigh both sides in an disagreement and give two points of view equal consideration. This ability extends even to issues surrounding the Force, and a Cerean Force-user often contemplates the light and dark side simultaneously.",

With an almost innate affinity for space travel, the Duros were among the first to leave their world and spread to the stars. Whatever the reason for their wanderlust, the Duros tend to gravitate toward the space lanes for income and adventure. Their home system is governed by vast starship engineering corporations, and most Duros learn to pilot a ship or rebuild a hyperdrive shortly after they begin to walk and talk.",

Prior to the Battle of Endor (four year after Episode IV), Ewoks were almost entirely unknown to the galaxy at large. Som traders and explorer visited Endor's moon, but with no form of space travel, Ewoks never left their homeworld. Although primitive by galactic standards, the tribal Ewoks are resourceful and highly adaptable. The tribal Ewoks may be technologically primitive when compared to most of the galactic society, but they are also clever and inventive. While they tend to initially be wary around machinery, it isn't long before their natural curiosity wins out and they plunge into wild and exuberant experimentation.",
